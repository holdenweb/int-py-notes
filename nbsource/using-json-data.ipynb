      "The [JSON data format](http://www.json.org/) has become a popular way to interchange data. It is more concise than XML, easier for humans to read should they have to, and supported by the ECMA-405 standard. Python comes with a `json` module that operates very like the `pickle` module does. You can convert between JSON strings and Python data structures using the `json.dumps()` method that takes a Python structure argument and returns a JSON string. The converse process is performed by the `json.loads()` method,which takes a JSON string as its argument and returns the corresponding Python data structure.\n",

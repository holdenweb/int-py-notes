Sometimes it's important to know that even under these circumstance _for mutable types_ slicing returns a new object copied from the original. You can confirm this by use of Python's [`id()` built-in function](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#id).\n",

Since the object cannot change, it does not matter. But a slicing operation promises you _your own copy of the data at the time the slice was taken_, which is why a new list is created even when all elements are included in the slice. If the source list later changes, your copy is insulated from those changes. Changes can't happen to immutable values."
